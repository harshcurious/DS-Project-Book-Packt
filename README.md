1. Create an environment with most required packages. You can call it whatever you want; here itâ€™s called `dspwp2`. Copy and paste, or type the entire statement here on one line in the terminal:

`conda create -n dspwp2 python=3.8.2 jupyter=1.0.0 pandas=1.2.1 scikit-learn=0.23.2 numpy=1.19.2 matplotlib=3.3.2 seaborn=0.11.1 python-graphviz=0.15 xlrd=2.0.1`

Type 'y' and \[Enter\] when prompted.

2. Activate the environment:

`conda activate dspwp2`

3. Install the remaining packages:

`conda install -c conda-forge xgboost=1.3.0 shap=0.37.0`

Type 'y' and \[Enter\] when prompted.

4. You are ready to use the environment. To deactivate it when finished:

`conda deactivate`
